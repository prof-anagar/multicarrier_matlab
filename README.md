2. Time and frequency synchronization of the OFDM signal.
3. The envelope characteristics of OFDM and PAPR reduction. Fundamentals of SC-FDMA.
4. Combining OFDM with MIMO.
5. Introduction to hardware SDR implementation. Implementation of OFDM in SDR. 
6. New multicarrier waveforms towards 6G mobile communications.
